 * NOTE:

 * This file is assumed to follow a strict format to allow easy parsing
 * by the hclib-options.py script. A list of the most important assumptions
 * is included below. See the script for exact details.
 *
 * - Lines starting with C++-style double-slash comments are assumed
 *   to be part of a description of a worker configuration option.
 *
 * - Definitions with the prefix HCLIB_WORKER_STRATEGY_ are assumed
 *   to be options for setting the worker context-management strategy.
 *
 * - Definitions with the prefix HCLIB_WORKER_OPTIONS_ are assumed
 *   to be additional options for the selected worker strategy.
 *
 * - Values for both types of definitions are assumed to be int constants.
